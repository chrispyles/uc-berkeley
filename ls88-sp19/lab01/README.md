# L&S 88 - Lab 1
_Lab by Christopher Pyles_

This is a lab that I wrote and faciliated for L&S 88: Reproducibility and Open Science. It focuses on how to annotate code so that others can reproduce your work using other technologies, and how to communicate and ask questions about code. It is designed to give students some basic Jupyter & Markdown experience, as well as to force them to think through and ask questions about another person's code.
