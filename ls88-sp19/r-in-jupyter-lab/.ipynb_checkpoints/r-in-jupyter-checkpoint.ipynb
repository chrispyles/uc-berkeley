    "By this point in our discussions of the various technologies involved in the data science community, you should be familiar with the idea that there are multiple tools to do the same job, and that some tools are better at some things than are others. The same is true of programming languages; each has its own strengths and weaknesses, Python included. In order to be a data scientist, it is imperitive that you know multiple languages and how to select the best for the function you are trying to perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Chris Holdgraf's presentation on the Jupyter suite, he talked for a minute about how open source languages are coming together with Jupyter to allow you to run different languages all in the same Jupyter notebook. In this lab, we'll pay close attention to this idea, with the intention of introducing you to some of the differences between languages and their strengths. We'll begin by showing you how to set up the aforementioned Jupyter environment and teach you some R, a popular statistics and data science language. The point of this lab is not to learn R, but to think about the different advantages of each language and how to select the right one for the job.\n",
