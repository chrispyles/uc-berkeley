    "Markdown is an integral feature of Jupyter Notebooks; it is a formatting language that allows you to create rich (that is, stylized) text. Jupyter supports Github flavored Markdown, which has some nice features like HTML output and syntax highlighting (we'll get to those later). Markdown is based on HTML (HyperText Markup Language, the language that webpages are written in) and is widely used across domains. It is an integral part of Jupyter notebooks, and it is in Markdown that we write the narrative that connects hard-to-follow code snippets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll go through an introduction to Markdown, beyond the simple rich text that it will let you create, and cover some of its more interesting characteristics. In particular, we'll cover things like code blocks, tables, embedding HTML, and other cool features. You don't need to know HTML for this lab, but you will be taught two tags (`div` and `img`) as well as HTML id's.\n",

    "| `---` | Line | N/A |\n",
    "\n",
    "To get literal characters such as \\_ and \\*, append a `\\` to the beginning of each: `\\_` or `\\*`. Using the hyperlink syntax, you link either to external webpages or to local files. For example, to link to the [test.pdf file](./test.pdf) in this directory, you would write `[test.pdf file](./test.pdf)`.\n",
    "\n",

    "    2. Sublist 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: if you make a list (either ordered or unordered), you need to leave a blank line between the last item and the start of your next paragraph, otherwise Markdown will render the next paragraph on the same line or with the same indentation. For example:\n",

Inline code appears within regular text, and is generated by surrounding text with backticks, `` ` ``. It does _not_ support syntax highlighting. In code blocks, the code is set aside from the text in a new paragraph. This is generated by wrapping the code block with three backticks. In Github flavored Markdown (which is what is in Jupyter Notebooks), this also allows you to use syntax highlighting. (Ever notice how in code cells some words are different colors or styles? That's syntax highlighting.) To make use of this feature, write the name of the language right after the backticks on the first line:\n",
