    "# L&S 88 - Lab x - Data Visualization with `matplotlib.pyplot`\n",
    "_Lab adapted by Chris Pyles from [Datahub Usage Analysis](https://github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/datahub-usage-analysis)_\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll cover the basics of one of the most important aspects of data science: data visualization. By this point, you should have some familarity with data visualization from the builtin `Table` methods that allow you to create plots, histograms, and the like, but today we'll cover the tool that underlies all of those: `pyplot`. The `pyplot` library, a subset of a larger plotting library called `matplotlib`, is a very powerful (if unintiuitive) tool that allows you to create robust data visualizations in Python. While there are some other tools that can be used in conjunction with `pyplot` and which make the code easier to write and understand (e.g. `seaborn`, `altair`), we won't be covering those in this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you continue in this lab, please take time to complete the [`pyplot` tutorial](pyplot.ipynb). This will give you the basic building blocks to understand how to answer the questions in this lab. If you find yourself struggling with a plot, post on Piazza or _Google the function_. We cannot stress enough how helpful this is. For example, if you didn't know how to choose where the $x$ ticks fall on a scatter plot, you should start by googling \"pyplot xticks\" and go from there."

For this particular project, the only real step is to convert the dates in the dates in both tables to something that we can use to analyze time trends.
